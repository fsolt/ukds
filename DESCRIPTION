Description: Reproducible, programmatic retrieval of datasets from the
    UK Data Service. The UK Data Service (UKDS) is "the UKâ€™s largest 
    collection of social, economic and population data resources," but
    researchers taking advantage of these datasets are caught in a bind.  
    The UKDS terms and conditions sharply limit redistribution of down-
    loaded datasets, but to ensure that one's work can be reproduced, 
    assessed, and built upon by others, one must provide access to the 
    raw data one employed.  The ukds package cuts this knot by providing
    programmatic, reproducible access to the UKDS datasets from within R.
